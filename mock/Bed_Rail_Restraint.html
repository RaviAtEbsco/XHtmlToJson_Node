      <p class="p">Raising all bed rails (2 full bed rails or 4 side rails), also referred to as side rails,
        on a bed is considered a <dfn class="term">physical restraint</dfn>. The use of bed rails is intended
        to reduce risk for falls and subsequent injury, and to prevent the patient from getting out
        of bed when medically contraindicated.</p>

          view that bed rails are inherently harmful was not adequately supported and suggested that
          instead of a universal reduction of bed rail use there should be a focus on eliminating
          outdated equipment and assessing appropriate bed rail use on a case-by-case basis.<sup class="ph sup"><a class="xref" href="Bed_Rail_Restraint.html#references__CMS_2014">1</a></sup></p>

          physical restraint use in older adult patients, researchers determined that both RNs and
          NAs reported that the most important reason to apply restraints was to prevent the patient
          from interfering with therapy (e.g., pulling out feeding tubes or I.V. catheters). NAs
          were more likely than RNs to state that physical restraints were important in preventing

            <li class="li">Environmental design that allows for close observation by staff</li>

            <li class="li">Promoting patient relaxation by creating a relaxing and comfortable environment
              (e.g., minimizing noise, offering soothing music, using appropriate lighting,
              performing patient massage, providing movement activities)</li>

            <li class="li">Use of bed and chair alarms to alert staff when a patient needs assistance</li>

            <li class="li">Placement of confused patients in rooms that are close to the nurses’ station</li>

      <div class="section" id="secondary_information__safety_guidelines"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Bed Rail Safety Guidelines</h3>
        
        <div class="p">Ongoing close attention must considered in the design, placement, and maintenance of
          bedrails and other parts of the bed: <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Bedrail bars should be appropriately spaced to prevent the patient’s head from
              passing through the opening and becoming trapped</li>

            <li class="li">The mattress should be correctly placed to prevent the patient from falling between
              the mattress and the bedrails</li>

            <li class="li">Check the mattress for shrinking and compression of the outside perimeter which
              would increase the space between the mattress and the bedrails</li>

            <li class="li">Check the mattress is the correct size for the bed</li>

            <li class="li">Fill the spaces between the bedrails and the mattress and the headboard with a firm
              inlay or a mattress </li>

            <li class="li">Latches securing bedrails should be stable </li>

            <li class="li">Older bedrail designs that have tapered or winged ends should not be used with
              patients at risk for entrapment</li>

            <li class="li">Ensure that patient needs (e.g., toileting, pain, comfort) are attended to at all
              times while the bed rails are up</li>

      <div class="section" id="secondary_information__involving_the_clinician"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Considerations for Involving the Clinician</h3>
        
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">If the restraint is applied in an emergent situation without a written order from the
            treating clinician, the treating clinician must perform an in-person assessment of the
            patient within 1 hour</li>

          <li class="li">The treating clinician’s assessment should include the patient’s need for bed rail
            restraint, the patient’s reaction to bed rail restraint, the patient’s behavioral and
            medical condition, and the need to continue or discontinue bed rail restraint</li>

          <li class="li">If the assessment is performed by an <dfn class="term">RN</dfn>, the RN must consult with the treating clinician as soon as possible
            following the assessment</li>

          <li class="li">Each order for physical restraint must be renewed every 4 hours for adult patients.
            Orders can be renewed for up to 24 hours, at which point the treating clinician must
            assess the patient in person before renewing an order</li>

      <div class="section" id="secondary_information__ongoing_assessment"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Ongoing Assessment</h3>
        
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">Release the bed rail restraints every 2 hours (or according to the treating
            clinician’s order) for 15 minutes in order to assist the patient to the bathroom, offer
            food and fluids, assess the skin and circulation, and perform range of motion
            exercises</li>

          <li class="li">Assess the patient frequently while restraints are in use. Evaluate for signs of
            injury every 15 minutes or according to facility protocol for the type of restraint that
            is used</li>

          <li class="li">Observe I.V. catheters, urinary catheters, and drainage tubes at regular intervals to
            verify that they are positioned correctly and are not occluded by the bed rail
            restraint</li>

          <li class="li">Verify that the treating clinician performs a face-to-face evaluation of the patient
            within an appropriate period of time according to the facility/unit protocol. Depending
            on the conditions surrounding restraint use, this evaluation can be performed daily
            thereafter</li>
